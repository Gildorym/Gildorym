This plugin was created by Godpuppet as he added the first few unique features to the server.
There are a few commands that were developed as a kind of alias for different things: newcharacter was created to start a new character by resetting all of a player's data, but Godpuppet wasn't really a developer, so he simply executed all of the commands required, either from console or from the sender of the command.
What you see here still runs on the server at the time of writing, although a lot of it is very messy and will need redoing at some point or other, perhaps rewriting entirely. Rollinfo will need to be discarded once we move towards a more D&D-like way of doing things.
